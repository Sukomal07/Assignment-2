## Components

The project has three main components, each representing a different feature:

1. `Login`: The component responsible for displaying the Instagram login form.
2. `SignUp`: The component responsible for displaying the Instagram sign-up form.
3. `Counter`: The component representing the counter app.

These components can be found in the `components` folder.

## Instagram Login/Sign Up Page

The Instagram login and sign-up pages are designed to mimic the appearance and functionality of the official Instagram login and sign-up forms. They provide an input field for the user's credentials and buttons to submit the form or switch between login and sign-up forms.

## Counter App

The counter app component displays a numerical value along with buttons to increment and decrement that value. It uses React state to maintain the counter's current state and updates the UI accordingly when the user interacts with the buttons.
